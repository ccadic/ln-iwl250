# ln-iwl250
Project to clone an iwl-250 to make it comptible with Lightning Network paiments

Hi all . This project consists in the reverse engineering of an old POS (Ingenico iWM-25O) terminal.
I'm trying to clone the main pcboard so we can replace the original one with the custom modified one and use an EDP32S2 
or Raspberry CM4 to gain access to Lightning Network functions and offer shopkeepers the option to accept LN/BTC payments

This project is under GPL3 and is for fun only. I do not promise I will finish it or that it will fully work.
Reverse ingineering closed products may be difficult as some parts may not be documented (thermal printer for instance; magnetic strip readers etc...)
